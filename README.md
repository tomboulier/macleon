## Overview

MacLeon is a command-line utility designed to clean up [AppleDouble files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleSingle_and_AppleDouble_formats) (`._*`) created by macOS when files are transferred to non-HFS file systems. Inspired by the meticulous "cleaner" from Luc Besson's film "LÃ©on" and a wordplay combining Mac and the immortal Highlander McLeod, MacLeon helps maintain cleanliness in your directories by removing unnecessary metadata files that clutter shared volumes or external storage devices.

## Features

- **Recursive Scanning:** Effortlessly scans directories and their subdirectories for AppleDouble files.
- **Cross-platform Compatibility:** Designed in Rust, MacLeon can be built and run on various operating systems, offering wide usability.
- **Simple CLI:** Easy-to-use command-line interface, making it suitable for both beginners and advanced users.

- **Safe Deletion:** Safely removes `._*` files, ensuring that only the unnecessary metadata files are deleted.
- **Dry Run Option:** Preview which files would be deleted without actually removing them, perfect for validation before cleanup.
